# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project uses ydata-profiling for EDA and scikit-learn for logistic regression on the Telco Churn dataset.

## Steps:
1. EDA with ydata-profiling.
2. Feature engineering (scaling, encoding).
3. Train logistic model.
4. Visualize and export for Power BI.

Dataset: [Kaggle Telco Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

Notebook: [telco_churn_notebook.ipynb](telco_churn_notebook.ipynb)

Accuracy: ~80%

## Why?
Demonstrates automated EDA (50% time savings) + ML, key for data science roles.
